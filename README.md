# EnvoyCopy
Here I tried to copy the website "Envoy" which is given to me as a project!

# Pointers
--> Not every buttons in the navbar are functional.
--> I have created this website in a rush because I didn't understand some concepts of React till now.

# Pages
--> There are 4 pages available in this website
    1. Home Page
    2. Sign In Page
    3. Sign Up Page
    4. Demo Page

# Contexts 
I have used 2 context provider
    1. Auth Context (Here I am checking That is user is loggedIn or not)
    2. User Details (Here I am setting userName and password for login)

# Sorry
I didn't add the media query for responsivness :-(
